# noSQL--Challenge-12
Module 12 Challenge
Greetings,
Please check out my work for Module 12 Challenge in regards to Eat Safe, Love.

NoSQL_setup.ipynb is where you will find my mongoDB set up that updated the uk_food db and establishments collection.

IMPORTANT: Import the data provided in the `establishments.json` file from your Terminal. Name the database `uk_food` and the collection `establishments`.

Within this markdown cell, copy the line of text you used to import the data from your Terminal. This way, future analysts will be able to repeat your process.

e.g.: Import the dataset with `mongoimport --type json -d uk_food -c establishments --drop --jsonArray establishments.json`

NoSQL_analysis.ipynb is where you will find the analysis portion of this assignment. Here youn will find answers to the following questions
    - Question 1: Which establishments have a hygiene score equal to 20? 
    - Question 2: Which establishments in London have a RatingValue greater than or equal to 4?
    - Question 3: What are the top 5 establishments with a RatingValue of 5, sorted by lowest hygiene score, nearest to the new restaurant added, "Penang Flavours"?
    - Question 4: How many establishments in each Local Authority area have a hygiene score of 0?

Please reach out if you should have any questions.

Thank You,
Kyle
